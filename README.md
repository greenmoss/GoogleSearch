# GoogleSearch

This program takes an excel document and searches the terms in that document. This gives you:
* An excel document that gives you the results per search
* The excel document also shows and how long it took the find those results
* Screen capture as a png, labeled appropriately 

This works for Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer

# TODO
* The navigation needs to be reworked a touch given i used the entire path for it's navigation. That should be an easy fix.
